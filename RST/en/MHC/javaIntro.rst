Why Learn Java?
=======================================

If you are coming from COMSC 151, you will have had quite a bit of experience with Python 
and may be wondering why we are learning another programming language.
Python is a nice language for beginning programming for several reasons.
First the syntax is sparse, and clear. Second, the underlying model of
how objects and variables work is very consistent. Third, you can write
powerful and interesting programs without a lot of work. However, Python
is representative of one kind of language, called a dynamic language.
You might think of Python as being fairly informal. There are other
languages, like Java, that are more formal.

These languages have some advantages of their own. First, is speed: Java code will generally give better performance than Python code. Second is their maintainability. A lot of what makes Python easy to use is that you must remember certain things. For example if you set variable ``x`` to reference a turtle, and forget later that ``x`` is a turtle but try to invoke a string method on it, you will get an error. Java protects you by forcing you to be upfront and formal about the kind of object each variable is going to refer to.

In one sense Python is representative of a whole class of languages,
sometimes referred to as “scripting languages.” Other languages in the
same category as Python are Ruby and Perl. Java is representative of
what we sometimes call industrial strength languages. Industrial strength
languages are good for projects with several people working on the
project where being formal and careful about what you do may impact lots
of other people. Languages in this category include also Rust, C++, and C#.

Programming languages will always change. As the field of computer
science advances there will be new programming languages and you will
need to learn them. It is important to learn several programming
languages so that you know what to expect. There are certain features
that most programming languages have in common; variables, loops,
conditionals, functions. And there are some features that are unique. If
you know what is common in languages that is a good place to start.
